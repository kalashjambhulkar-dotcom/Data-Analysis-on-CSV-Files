This code is a complete Python data analysis workflow designed to extract and visualize sales insights from the "Global_Superstore-CSV.csv" dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Code Purpose
The main goal is to load a large sales dataset, perform group-wise aggregations (using Pandas' groupby and sum functions), and generate clear visual summaries that highlight sales performance across key business dimensions such as product category, sub-category, and geographic region.

Key Steps
Data Loading & Inspection:
The code imports the dataset, displays its structure, and handles date parsing for time-based analysis.

Aggregation:
It groups and totals sales by product Category, Sub-Category, Region, Country, and Customer Segment, printing summary tables for each to identify top-performing groups quickly.

Visualization:
It creates bar charts for category-level, sub-category, and region sales, saving each visualization as an image. These charts make it easy to see which products or regions drive the most revenue, and can support business or exam readiness needs.

Typical Applications
This analysis is fundamental for business intelligence, supporting quick decision making about which areas are profitable or need improvement. By automating these workflows in a Jupyter Notebook or Colab, users can repeat analyses for different datasets, update charts automatically, and summarize insights without manual effort.
